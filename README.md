# IBM_HR_Analytics_Employee_Attrition_-_Performance

Overview

This project analyzes employee attrition and performance data from the IBM HR Analytics dataset. The goal is to derive meaningful insights into factors influencing employee turnover and performance, enabling organizations to make data-driven decisions to improve retention and workforce efficiency.

Objectives

Identify key factors contributing to employee attrition.
Analyze performance trends and their relationship with employee satisfaction.
Build predictive models to estimate attrition risk.
Provide actionable recommendations to HR teams for workforce optimization.

Dataset
The dataset, sourced from IBM HR Analytics, contains information on:
Employee demographics (age, gender, education, etc.)
Job-related data (department, job role, salary, etc.)
Work-life balance, satisfaction levels, and attrition status.
Methodology

Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning: Handling missing and inconsistent data.
Encoding: Converting categorical features into numerical formats.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
